/**
 * Game of Life World
 *
 * The universe of the Game of Life is a two-dimensional orthogonal grid of
 * square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive
 * or dead.
 *
 * Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
 * horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the
 * following transitions occur:
 *
 * - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by
 *   underpopulation.
 *
 * - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
 *   generation.
 *
 * - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
 *   overpopulation.
 *
 * - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as
 *   if by reproduction.
 *
 * - The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first
 *   generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every
 *   cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete
 *   moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words,
 *   each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules
 *   continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
