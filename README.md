# reason-react-gof

This is a simple implementation of the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) that I created to help me learn ReasonML/Bucklescript/React.

## Architecture

This application has been bootstrapped using [`reason-scripts`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-scripts).  To get started run the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn run start
```
